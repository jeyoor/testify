To watch everything that goes into the Redis server, connect to it via telnet,
and run the monitor command.

  $ telnet localhost 6379
  > auth test
  > monitor

You'll get to see every command that hits the server.

If you want to muck around with Redis yourself, you can do so easily from
Python:

  $ easy_install redis
  $ python
  >> from redis import Redis
  >> rserv = Redis(hostname='localhost', port=6379)
  >> rserv.auth('test')
  >> rserv.keys('template*html')
  1
  template:my_template:html
  >> rserv.get('template:my_template:html')

Of course, if you want to go old-school, you can run these commands from telnet.

  ...
  > keys template*html
  > get template:my_template:html
