OBSCURE ERRORS
    java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Parameter declaration if should be a vector (persist.clj:6)
    May be thrown by defn missing params vector
    i.e. (defn blah ) without []
    Leiningen takes class names with hyphen (ex: test-redis) and converts file/dirnames with underscore (test_redis)

Cntr-L clears the lein repl! :-D

#{} is sets

[& params] MAKES A LIST OF THE REMAINING PARAMS. (& gives it)
[:as params] TAKES ALL THE REMAINING PARAMS (& gives 'em)

#(re-gsub #"\n" "" %) 
Anonymous function
%N is the Nth arg
This specific one regexes and swaps stuff

If things aren't compiling, kill lein ring server and restart.
If classpath isn't, run "lein classpath".

(partition 2 [1 2 3 4 5 6])
 == ((1 2) (3 4) ...)
 
 (interleave colls) [concat first items of colls, the 2nd, etc.]
 
 (zipmap [:key1 :key2] [val1 val2] )
    == {:key2 val2, :key1 val1}

    Syntax
        backquote (`) is the syntax quote
            just expands to the text
        tilde (~) is the unquote
              (~@) expands a quoted thing to a list [good for stmt lists]
        hash  (#) is the syntax gen-symbol
    Uses
        Only evaluate SOME of the args
            Example: if-then-else            
        Expand, THEN evaluate
            Example: I want these stmts to run in my db context
    Tips
        ` everything that you want to expand into
        within the `, use name# to create hygenic local names
        ~fn or ~stmt UNQUOTE (evals) the stuff appropriately
        This avoids having to pass a buncha anon funs i.e. 
        #(dostuff %) instead of just dostuff
        
CONCURRENCY (when immutable isn't enough :-)
