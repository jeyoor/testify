redis notes

Redis is a data structure server.

INCR (atomic increment)

Keys are "binary safe"

Some sort of schema for keys is helpful
object-type:id:field

Redis uses linked lists for List data type

Lists -- sequentially ordered, thousands possible

Sets -- unordered (good for tags),
    SADD (set add), SREM, SUNION (no duplicates)

0 is false. (fail)
1 is true.

CLOJURE CLIENT
    returns true/false instead of 1/0
