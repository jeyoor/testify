        Use persistence framework (Redis)

            Create CRUD macros (save typing)
            Fix "broken pipe" connection pooling issue
        Unit testing
        Input validation

        Learn redis-clojure connection pooling stuff
        

Action Points
    Finish coding sitemap
        /admin
        /resource/rname 
            use ring.util.response/file-response 
            from redis to memory buffer?
        /admin/resource/form
        /admin/resource/save
        /admin/resource/delete
        /admin/template/delete
        /admin/page/delete
        /page/delete
    Debugging prod
        Alter failsafe to check for that exception
        Debug why redis calls were failing
            Redis was fine, routing was wrong.
                Using when? is NOT OK.
    Typing on view-page (need IMG tags at right places) 
    Tranactional redis
        make update tranact
    Clarify routes 
        move restore to admin
        NOTE: route/not-found returns  (routes (ANY "/a/url" [aoeu] {response} ))
    Verify that prod error routing is correct
    Improve appear.clj
        use maps for args to snippets
        Validate HTML
        Make many lis under one ul instead of current step
    Make docstrings, comments, etc. more consistent
    Cleanup persist.clj/restore 
        Go back and make restore-page defaults good
        Make restore-names generic (allow hash restore? Maybe ascii ok)
